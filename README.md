## Task #1 (Setting up git)

:tada: You just installed and configured git to keep your basic information with your GitHub account.

## Task #2 (Working with your own project)
  1. Make a new directory/folder and initialize it as a git repository 
  2. Make a empty repository on GitHub
  3. Add that repository as a remote in local repository naming it "origin"
  4. Add a python script in that repository doing addition of two variables
  5. Stage the file to be committed
  6. Commit the staged file
  7. Push the changes to the remote

:tada: You just created your first repository on GitHub and synced your local code to it. Suppose you want to make new changes, just repeat the steps from 5 to 7.

## Task #3 (Working with someone else's code)
  1. Fork the repository this repository
  2. Clone the repository you just got under your GitHub id on your local system
  3. Add the original repository as a new remote naming it "upstream"
  4. Make a new folder under `/pulls` with your roll number
  5. Add a python code to do binary sort for an array from user input
  6. Stage the file to be committed
  7. Commit the staged file
  8. Push the changes to the remote
  9. Visit the original repository on GitHub using browser and submit a Pull Request

:tada: You just submitted your first pull request! Consider doing the same when you want to fix some bugs or add a feature in someone's code. Once your Pull Request is merged you can pull the lastest updates from the remote "upstream" to update your local repository and then push the changes to remote "origin" to keep your copy of code up-to-date too!
